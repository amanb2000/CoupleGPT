There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline ",

These objects consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms.

These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration."
